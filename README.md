**BIGOS** – **B**inary **I**nelastic scattering and **G**eneralized **O**ptical cross **S**ection package is a set of FORTRAN 90 codes that
allow the user to obtain various physical quantities related to the scattering problem involving diatomic molecules and
atoms. The package is being developed at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń.

Here, we present the SCATTERINC code, the central part of the BIGOS package.
The purpose of the SCATTERING code is to solve the coupled equations for a given scattering system, provide the
scattering S-matrix elements and calculate the state-to-state cross-sections.

**Please read the [Program Description](doc/page/index.html).**

@note
This version of the code is adjusted for diatom - atom collision systems,<br>
in particular the H<sub>2</sub> - He system. <br>
