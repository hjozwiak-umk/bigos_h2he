Due to MOLSCAT's large computational time for itype = 7 with a large number of coupling terms,
I have run parallel calculations for each JTOT block.

"pre_oH2He7.in" is a template input file. Each task in the job array modifies "jtotl" and "jtotu" values,
to run one JTOT block at a time.

"out.*", where * = 0, 1, ... 50, correspond to the output of each JTOT block.

S-matrices resulting from parallel calculations were later combined into one file and 
state-to-state cross-sections were calculated using one of MOLSCAT's post-processors.

The output of the post-processor is given in "final_output.dat" file.
